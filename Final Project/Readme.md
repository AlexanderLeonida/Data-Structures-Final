|------------------------------|-------|
| Code Deliverable             |  50   |
| Documentation                |  25   |
| Presentation                 |  15   |
| Reflection                   |  10   |
|  __Total__                   |  100  |

As a reminder this project forms 25% of your final grade. The work you turn in should reflect this.

## Motivation
The goal of the final project is to show off what you have learned through the year. Rather than give a final exam, I would rather see your ability expressed through accomplishing a goal using code. This document outlines the basics for the project and how it will be delivered, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond. Work beyond what is expected will be recognized and __extra points will be awarded__.

## General Requirements
For this project you are going to be answering some question using simulation. Think to the Airplane boarding example we watched earlier in the year. You are welcome to think problem first, or simulation first. Either way is fine with me, as long as you are not 'just simulating for fun.' __There must be some output, some measurable outcome.__  

This project must utilize good and appropriate:
* classes
* data structures
* algorithm design

This project may be completed as a group of two. If you are working in a group, the expectation is that the overall effort will reflect such. All code will be written utilizing pair programming, utilizing whatever appropriate tools (like the Live Share extension). This means that both group members will be actively engaged when code is being worked on. The rest of the work should be evenly divided among the group and all group members should review all work before submitting it.

All artifacts, with the exception of the individual feedback sent via email, will be submitted via this Whitgit repository. For non-code things you are welcome and encouraged to submit links instead of uploading. This includes presentation material, code documentation and design material. Just make sure access settings are correctly set. If I cannot get to it, I cannot grade it! 

Expectation of professionalism: Pretend that you are doing this for a job promotion. Your overall goal should be to impress me, to show me your mastery of the material and how to best present the work you have done. This document is the bare-minimum, what *must* be done, not what *could* be done. You are responsible for organizing this repository and putting your work into the best light. Use your best, reasonable, judgement.  

## Project Proposal (optional)
After some brainstorming, you can submit a project proposal for review. This is not required, but highly suggested. I will review your plan and give you a thumbs up, or a suggestion of how to make the project either more rigorous (the solution would be too easy) or how to re-frame the problem to make is easier to solve (your planned solution is too difficult for this level class).

You don't want to be the person that I have to tell after that their work is not sufficient for the class. That stinks for me and it will stink for you.

These proposals need to be submitted __before__ Friday 5/1/2024.

## Deliverables

-------------------------

### Documentation

You will submit a document (.md, .docx, .pdf) in this repository that contains the following:
* Detailed description of the problem this project attempts to solve and/or a detailed purpose statement.
* Clear and Detailed Requirements for the project. This should directly trace to your Classes and Functions.
* Clear overview of the simulation and how all of the different elements work.
* A detailed report and analysis of your findings.
* Detailed use case and manual for how to run your project.
* Works Cited. This includes any third party libraries used, any online sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should be mirrored in your code.

Your code must be appropriately commented. This includes headers for every method/function and file headers.

As a note, detailed means: "having many details or facts; showing attention to detail". This means that I should have _zero_ questions about what you did, how you did it and why. Look at how long this document is. This is just the documentation for the framework of the project. Take that into consideration when developing your documentation.

-------------------------

### Presentation

During your section's final exam slot, you will participate in the presentation of these final projects. You are expected to show respect to your classmates and engage with their cool projects, as they are expected to engage with your presentation. I don't really care about the format, if you want to pre-record it, that would be fine. You don't need slides, but you are welcome to use them. Do whatever makes the most sense for your project (and meets the below requirements). 

Your presentation should:
* outline your project, the question you are trying to engage with and what conclusions you made
* highlight the main points of your simulation
* include a demonstration, but only if it aids in understanding
* clearly identify the path forward for the project. What would you do next if you were to keep working on it?
* identify major problems that were encountered and how you overcame them
  * Keep these actionable
  * 'get to work sooner' and 'do more documentation/design' are not that interesting

Your presentation should not:
* be a code review. Selections of code is fine, but we don't need to see every line of code. We want to see results!

We have a lot of time. I would say that you should aim for 10ish minutes. At the same time think about what your peers are interested in hearing about. You have a lot to cover, but you don't want to be boring: concise and clear presentations are necessary.  

Make sure all group members participate in the presentation.

-------------------------

### Project Implementation  

As with all code turned in for this class, the same rules apply here for this final project.  

You will be graded on proper coding style. Your code must be readable and have good comments describing what is going on. Variable names should make sense, classes and their methods should be obvious, and variables should be descriptive. Use proper indentation.  

At this point in your CS career you should be able to take advantage proper code re-use and functionalization. Each function should only do one thing. If it is doing many things, those should be functionalized. Remember you have the power of templates, pointers and polymorphism too.  

Your code should line up with your documentation. All citations should be clearly marked and identified.

-------------------------

## Reflection

Each member of the team needs to submit a personal project reflection to Scott via email (sgriffith@whitworth.edu). This email needs to be submitted **after** the final project submission, but before the end of finals week.

Your reflection should take you more than 30 minutes. You should justify all of the bellow, not just list them out. If it is obviously thrown together last minute, you will not get full points. 

You reflection should include a **minimum** of:
* Argument for evaluation outcome (i.e. what grade do you think you deserve?)
* Reflection on the process
  * What went well?
  * What didn't go well?
  * What would you change if you did this project again?
* Favorite part of the project? What do you feel really good about?
* (if in a team) How did your partner do? 
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of them?
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of how good of a teammate you were?
* Any thoughts on how I (as the instructor) can better prepare, set-up or execute the final project in the future?
